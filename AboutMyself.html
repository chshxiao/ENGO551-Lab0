        <b class="first_word">Hello</b>, everyone! Welcome to my webpage. This is a brief introduction of myself.
      I'm Chunsheng Xiao, but you can call me Roy. I'm originated from China and
      now living in Calgary. I'm studying Geomatics Engineering at the University
      of Calgary. This is my last semester and I'm looking forward to graduate so
      much!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b class="first_word">I'm</b> an outdoor person. I love all outdoor activities. Here are
      several of them:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Biking</li>
      <li>Soccer</li>
      <li>Badminton</li>
      <li>hiking</li>
      <li>fishing</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b class="first_word">Among</b> them, <a href="InterestBike.html" class="hyperlink">Biking</a> and 
      badminton are two of my favourites. I spend lot of times
      on them every year. Here is my <a href="TourToJasper.html" class="hyperlink">tour</a> this summer.
      I pedaled to Edmonton and then went to Jasper there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b class="first_word">This</b> is the first HTML <a href="FirstHtmlProject.html" class="hyperlink">project</a> I made.
      It's a very simple calcultor doing different kinds of operation of two numbers.
