# ENGO551-Lab0

This is the ENGO551 Lab0 webpage created by Chunsheng Xiao.

The main page is AboutMyself.html. Two headers are h1 and h2 respectively. I used the scss variable to set them both blue. The enlarged first word of each paragraph is achieved by scss inheritance. Another derived style class is the hyerper link format below.

The biking page is a page about my biking hobby. On the upper left corner, there's a Back linkto go back to the introduction page. This hyperlink is available at every page except the introduction. Here, we will go to the third page.

The third page is a collection of photos in Jasper. I used media query here to change the size of the images when the screen gets below 900 pixel. A scss nesting is applied to the text and the images in this page.

The last page is a bootstraps demo page. All the elements are arranged by bootstrap's grid model. Here's a question to answer. If you choose the correct answer, you will get a True in the bootstrap alert. Otherwise, you will get a false.
